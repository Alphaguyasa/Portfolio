# Roadmap

Priority: P0 (money or policy at risk), P1 (broken or misleading), P2 (quality), P3 (later).
Effort: S (under an hour), M (a run), L (several runs). Take the top open item.

## Open

### R13. [P3 · M] Claim abuse limits
Each new Internet Identity gets free tokens, so one person can drain the reserve and grow canister
memory (Sybil). This only matters on a shared network: see A5 before building anything.

### R14. [P3 · L] ICRC-1 ledger (waits for A6)
Standard API, decimals, fee, memo, `created_at_time` deduplication (replay protection) and a
transaction log.

### R16. [P2 · M] Move from dfx to icp-cli
dfx now prints "dfx is deprecated, use icp-cli". It still works and is pinned at 0.32.0 in CI. Plan
the move for the scripts, CI and docs before dfx stops getting fixes.

### R15. [P3 · S] Localization
All strings are English and hard-coded. Move them out and add Amharic when Alpha wants it.

## Done

- Repo setup: CI, release tags, context files, threat model ([#1](https://github.com/Alphaguyasa/Alpha-digital-coin/pull/1)).
- R1. `transfer` and `claim` made safe ([#2](https://github.com/Alphaguyasa/Alpha-digital-coin/pull/2)).
- R2. Price display and false claims removed from the site, notice added ([#3](https://github.com/Alphaguyasa/Alpha-digital-coin/pull/3)). `components/ui/asset-card.tsx` is deleted: it showed a balance as US dollars with a percentage and a leverage badge.
- R3. Integer amounts in the frontend: amounts are parsed to `bigint` in `lib/amount.ts` and never pass through a JavaScript number ([#5](https://github.com/Alphaguyasa/Alpha-digital-coin/pull/5)).
- R4. Network configuration that fails closed: canister IDs come from `dfx deploy` via `.env.local`, only a local replica is accepted, and an unconfigured build shows an error ([#6](https://github.com/Alphaguyasa/Alpha-digital-coin/pull/6)).
- R5. Dashboard error handling: every call ends loading and shows a message, the recipient is checked before sending, canister results get plain messages, and a failed balance read keeps the last balance marked stale ([#8](https://github.com/Alphaguyasa/Alpha-digital-coin/pull/8)).
- R6. Dead links and controls: landing navigation links to its sections, and the wallet dialog no longer refers to Terms and Privacy pages that do not exist (A8) ([#9](https://github.com/Alphaguyasa/Alpha-digital-coin/pull/9)).
- R7. Dead code and unused dependencies removed: `@icp-sdk/*`, `radix-ui`, `@radix-ui/react-slot`, `class-variance-authority`, the unused button component and wallet icons. `shadcn` moved to dev dependencies (only its stylesheet is used, at build time). A test now fails if a runtime dependency is not imported.
- R8. Dashboard layout and accessibility: the grid stacks on phones, inputs have real labels, status messages use a live region that is always mounted, styles follow the light and dark themes with AA contrast, focus rings are visible, reduced-motion is respected, and the landing navigation shows on phones.
- R9. Balance polling stops while the tab is hidden, refreshes on return, and backs off from 5 seconds to a minute on repeated failures.
- R10. The about-section image is now a local SVG, so the page makes no request to a third-party image host. A test keeps it that way.
- R11. Dashboard component tests: the real page is rendered in jsdom with the canister replaced, covering signed out, unconfigured, signed in, loading, each failure, exact amounts and hidden-tab polling. New dev dependencies (esbuild, jsdom, Testing Library) are MIT licensed with no high audit findings.
- R17. `npm audit` is at zero findings: `eslint-config-next` upgraded (with its stricter rules fixed in the dashboard and card stack), `shadcn` dropped from dependencies with its Tailwind preset vendored in `app/shadcn-preset.css`, and `minimatch` pinned past its advisory for the lint tooling.
- R12. CodeQL runs on every push and weekly for the TypeScript code, and lists its findings in the run log. First analysis: zero findings.
